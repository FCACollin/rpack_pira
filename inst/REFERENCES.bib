  abstract       = {The aim of the study was to verify the association of clinical relapses and brain activity with disability progression in relapsing/remitting multiple sclerosis patients receiving disease-modifying treatments in Poland. Disability progression was defined as relapse-associated worsening (RAW), progression independent of relapse activity (PIRA), and progression independent of relapses and brain MRI Activity (PIRMA). Data from the Therapeutic Program Monitoring System were analyzed. Three panels of patients were identified: R0, no relapse during treatment, and R1 and R2 with the occurrence of relapse during the first and the second year of treatment, respectively. In the R0 panel, we detected 4.6% PIRA patients at 24 months (p &lt; 0.001, 5.0% at 36 months, 5.6% at 48 months, 6.1% at 60 months). When restricting this panel to patients without brain MRI activity, we detected 3.0% PIRMA patients at 12 months, 4.5% at 24 months, and varying from 5.3% to 6.2% between 36 and 60 months of treatment, respectively. In the R1 panel, RAW was detected in 15.6% patients at 12 months and, in the absence of further relapses, 9.7% at 24 months and 6.8% at 36 months of treatment. The R2 group was associated with RAW significantly more frequently at 24 months compared to the R1 at 12 months (20.7%; p &lt; 0.05), but without a statistical difference later on. In our work, we confirmed that disability progression was independent of relapses and brain MRI activity.},
